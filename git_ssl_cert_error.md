Hey are you facing the following error?
> Cloning into '<repo_name>'...
fatal: unable to access '<git_repo_link>': SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

- Configure Git to Use SChannel (Windows): Beginning with Git for Windows 2.14, you can configure Git to use SChannel, the built-in Windows networking layer, as the crypto backend. This means it will use the Windows certificate storage mechanism, and you wonâ€™t need to explicitly configure the curl CA storage mechanism1.
To enable this, update your Git installation to a version that supports SChannel.
```powershell
git config --global http.sslbackend schannel
```
