# Error
- I faced this problem in Mozilla Firefox, firefox wouldn't open.
- Troubleshoot by running `sudo firefox`
- error message obtained:
```bash
error: not connected to gnome-3-38-2004 content interface
```  
# Reason:
Due to uncertain circumstances, the plug `gnome-3-38-2004` may not be available or it isnt connected to the snap `firefox` 

# Solution:
- Firstly disconnect the snap from the plug by:
```bash
sudo snap disconnect firefox:gnome-3-38-2004
```
This avoids possible interruptions.
- Then run this command to install `gnome-3-38-2004`
```bash
snap install gnome-3-38-2004
```
- After installation, run this:
```bash
sudo snap connect firefox:gnome-3-38-2004
```
- Hope this works!
