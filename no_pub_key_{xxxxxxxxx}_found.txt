while doing system modifying operations like 
sudo apt-get -y install <application>
apt update & apt upgrade & apt autoremove
Do you face errors like:
Err:18 http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb stable Release.gpg                
  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY {XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}
These keys are often placed in the instaler config or added to facilitate the installation or modification of applications, webpages etc.
Don't worry I got you!!
type the command
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys {XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}
if this doesn't resolve the issue , which it normally always works, do check your network connection. 
Thank you!!!
Until next Time
